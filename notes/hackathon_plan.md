# ‚ö° 48-Hour Golang Hackathon Sprint Plan
**Project:** Distributed Background Job System  
**Goal:** Build a functioning, observable background job system in Go, demonstrating concurrency, reliability, and performance.

---

## üóìÔ∏è Overview

- **Total Duration:** 48 hours  
- **Output:** Working MVP, Prometheus metrics, clean code, and profiling data.  
- **Focus:** Learn-by-doing ‚Üí each milestone unlocks one key Golang concept.  
- **Approach:** Work in 2 √ó 12-hour sprints (with breaks) across 2 days.  
- **Stack:** Go, Redis, Docker, Prometheus, Makefile, optional Postman.

---

## üß© Day 1 ‚Äî Build Core System (Concurrency + Queue + API)

### Hour 0‚Äì1: Project setup
- Initialize module: `go mod init github.com/<you>/jobrunner`
- Create folder structure:
```

cmd/api/
cmd/worker/
internal/queue/
internal/worker/
internal/handlers/

````
- Add `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` with Redis + app skeleton.
- Goal: repo runs `go run cmd/api/main.go` and prints ‚Äúserver up‚Äù.

---

### Hour 2‚Äì3: Define Job structure & interfaces
- Create `Job` struct:
```go
type Job struct {
    ID   string
    Type string
    Data []byte
}
````

* Define job handler interface and registry (`map[string]HandlerFunc`).
* Implement dummy handlers (`email`, `resize_image`, etc.).
* Goal: job type can be registered dynamically.

**Learning focus:** Go interfaces, maps, and modular design.

---

### Hour 4‚Äì5: Redis queue implementation

* Create `internal/queue/redis.go`:

  * `Enqueue(job Job)` ‚Üí `LPUSH`
  * `Dequeue()` ‚Üí `BRPOP` (blocking)
* Handle JSON serialization/deserialization.
* Test via `go run` with manual enqueue/dequeue loop.

**Learning focus:** Redis client usage, marshaling, goroutine-safe I/O.

---

### Hour 6‚Äì7: Worker pool basics

* Build worker pool with goroutines and `sync.WaitGroup`.
* Add `Start()` method that spawns N workers reading from a jobs channel.
* Add graceful shutdown logic (context + signal handling).
* Test with dummy jobs.

**Learning focus:** goroutines, channels, WaitGroups, graceful exit.

---

### Hour 8‚Äì9: Connect HTTP API ‚Üí Queue

* `cmd/api/main.go`: implement `POST /jobs` endpoint.

* Return job ID.
* Add minimal JSON validation.

**Learning focus:** Go HTTP server, encoding/json, modularity.

---

### Hour 10‚Äì11: Integrate worker ‚Üí queue

* Worker continuously polls Redis for jobs.
* When job found ‚Üí decode ‚Üí invoke handler.
* Log progress per job ID.
* Use contexts for per-job timeout (30s).

**Learning focus:** context propagation, structured logging.

---

### Hour 12: Checkpoint & cleanup

* Refactor into clean packages.
* Run `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, and `go fmt ./...`.
* Ensure build succeeds in Docker.
* Run `docker-compose up` ‚Üí enqueue a few jobs ‚Üí process successfully.

‚úÖ **End of Day 1 Goal:**
Working MVP: enqueue jobs via API ‚Üí workers consume & log success.

---

## üß† Day 2 ‚Äî Reliability, Observability & Performance

### Hour 13‚Äì14: Add retry & backoff

* Add retry logic to worker:

  ```go
  for attempt := 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++ {
      err := handler(ctx, job)
      if err == nil { break }
      delay := backoff(1*time.Second, attempt, 30*time.Second)
      time.Sleep(delay)
  }
  ```
* Implement exponential backoff.
* Log attempts and failures.

**Learning focus:** error handling, exponential functions, idempotency.

---

### Hour 15‚Äì16: Implement graceful shutdown fully

* Use `context.WithCancel()` + signal.Notify for SIGINT/SIGTERM.
* Stop HTTP server, close job channels, and wait for workers.
* Ensure no jobs are lost or half-processed.
* Test with Ctrl+C and ensure clean exit logs.

**Learning focus:** context lifecycle, defers, proper cleanup.

---

### Hour 17‚Äì18: Add Prometheus metrics

* Add `/metrics` endpoint in API.
* Export:

  * `jobs_processed_total`
  * `jobs_failed_total`
  * `job_duration_seconds` (histogram)
* Integrate `promhttp.Handler()`.

**Learning focus:** instrumentation, monitoring fundamentals.

---

### Hour 19‚Äì20: Add pprof profiling

* Add `/debug/pprof` route.
* Generate CPU & heap profiles:

  ```bash
  go tool pprof http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile
  ```
* Run `go tool pprof` and analyze flamegraph.

**Learning focus:** introspection, performance tuning.

---

### Hour 21‚Äì22: Write unit & integration tests

* Mock job handlers and test:

  * Job enqueue/dequeue cycle.
  * Worker start/stop correctness.
* Integration: use Redis test instance (from docker-compose).
* Run with `go test -race ./...`.

**Learning focus:** testing, race detection, modularity.

---

### Hour 23‚Äì24: Add Docker-compose and run demo

* Services:

  * `api` ‚Üí HTTP server
  * `worker` ‚Üí background processor
  * `redis` ‚Üí queue store
  * `prometheus` ‚Üí metrics scraper
* Verify cross-service communication.

‚úÖ **End of Half-Sprint Goal:**

You can now process jobs safely with metrics and shutdown logic.

---

## üîß Day 2 ‚Äî Deepen Reliability + Prepare Interview Demo

### Hour 25‚Äì26: Add dead-letter queue

* Demonstrate throttling jobs per second.

**Learning focus:** resource management, concurrency tuning.

---

### Hour 29‚Äì30: Context cancellation for job timeout
